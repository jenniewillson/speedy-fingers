# SPEEDY FINGERS

Speedy fingers is a fun website that allows a user to practice their typing, encouraging improvement in both accuracy and speed together. Using randomly generated words, with increasing or mixed numbers of letters, the user can compete against themselves to improve the speed and gain both a higher number of accurate words and a faster average speed of word completed.

It's aim is to be simple, but effective - to have a fun response for the user without being overcomplicated or distracting.

### Speedy fingers - the simple but effective way to improve your typing!
As modern life depends more and more on the ability to use a keyboard, in work, at home, in our hobbies and in our general life administration, the ability to type quickly and accurately has become more and more important. A lot of us will spend a large amount of our computing time on mobile phones, which makes typing a lot simpler, but there are still a lot of situations in which we need to use a manual keyboard, and because we don't do that as often, we need some practice!

Using desktop computer applications and websites tend to auto-correct us a lot less, so accuracy is important, as well as speed. When filling in forms it can be essential to get important details correct, otherwise we can cause major delays or miss important information. The key to this is being able to be confident in our ability to type accurately as well as quickly - so that we can get on with the rest of our life, knowing that we have not wasted any unnecessary time.

Speedy fingers is the perfect way to have a bit of fun testing yourself with randomly generated words, starting with shorter words and increasing in length as you progress, with an immediate visual reward to show how well you are doing!

## Design Choices

The core principles of this website are that it is simple, fun and not distracting. Users should be attracted to using it, encouraged to keep coming back to improve and it should make them smile. It should be immediately obvious how to use it and not require a lot of complicated instructions. The feedback to the user should be obvious and immediately recognisable.

### Colours

The colours are chosen with the design principles in mind of simplicity and fun. I have chosen primary colours, with clear meanings, such as red when something is incorrect and green when it is correct, with yellow (gold) used for the reward!

#### Colour  palette

![Speedy fingers colour palette](https://github.com/jenniewillson/speedy-fingers/assets/127458925/3f833237-454f-4195-9bcc-c79d73e17970)


### Typography

Typography is really important for Speedy fingers, as it is important that it is easy for the user to read what they are typing, without mis-reading words or letters. I initially thought I would be looking for a sans-serif with characters that apppeared as much like the simple writing one is taught as a child. However, having googled to find out more, I discovered from [a Techradar article](https://www.techradar.com/news/google-has-released-a-new-font-it-says-makes-reading-online-easier) that Google's Roboto Serif font had been designed with just this thing in mind, to be the easiest font for reading online. I concluded that Google were the experts on this, rather than me, so have decided to use that font!

I want to ensure the website is as simple as possible, so 

### Imagery

All images used were provided and labelled by Steve Willson, an experienced Trainspotter. They are selected to represent the three themes of the website.

The logo is designed to look like a train numberplate, using recognisable colours and similar font as above, so it will all feel familiar to users.

### Animations and Transitions

Many users will not be hugely confident internet/app users and so animations should be kept simple and functional. They obviously highlight hovered menu items and icons with a change of colour and weight, without adding any other animation that might be distracting or offputting.

## Site Structure

This website is multiple pages, keeping each page simple and dedicated to a particular subject and ensuring it is easy to find what is needed.

Multiple intuitive navigation options are simple without overcrowding, allowing users to read menus and use those - or use familiar links such as the logo or the footer icons.

The default is the Home page, giving information about the Trainiacs concept and easy options to navigate elsewghere. It provides just enough information but not too much.

The main menu and footer appear on every page. The menu will take the user to every other page they need to navigate to. The footer will also take them to the sign-up menu as well as giving options for social media and phone and email contacts.

The main Trainiacs logo always navigates back to the home page.

The images on the Home Page will navigate to the relevant pages - and each of those pages has easy links to the contact page.

The contact page will redirect to a page to confirm the form has been submitted and this also contains a link to home within the text, as well as the usual header and footer links and menus.

There is a customer 404 page which is kept within the theme, is fun and also provides an easy link back to the home page within the main text.

# Features

## Version control

At the beginning of the project I had two problems - firstly that I had misunderstood the teaching videos and thought it was telling me to commit code after each session of work. Secondly I had a problem with CodeAnywhere which was preventing me from committing anything as it kept telling me it didn't know my identity and the suggested fixes were not working. I had to carry on working due to time constraints.

Once this was resolved and I understood the requirement I have been committing code much more regularly and after each major change and recognise that this is the correct way to work and manage the code and project. I am unable to go back and change this, but have done my best to improve this going forward.

## Implemented features

### Header

- Priority - brand identity and easy navigation
- Used logo that fitted with the theme
- Logo links back to home page, as this is intuitive as a lot of websites work this way
- Menu is responsive - Hamburger for smaller screens and navbar for wider
- Did consider navbar remaining at top when scrolling but decided this wasn't an essential as only the gallery page is likely to scroll the menu out of sight.

### Footer

- Contact us link - intuitive to users to find this in the footer, despite it being available elsewhere
- Telephone contact and email available here as likely to be preferred by target audience
- Social media links avaialble and opening in a new tab

### Home page

- Pictures to capture the user's interest
- Immediate obvious links to theme pages from large pictures as well as menu
- Simple and styled to theme

### Theme pages

- three clear sections, as below
- clear separation with background
- easy links where needed, covering whole section rather than requiring pixel hunting
- links in addition to menu

#### Meetings

- clearly showing the next few meetings
- fun 'timeline' icon of train track fits with theme
- links to meeting location where relevant, also opening in separate tabs

#### Contact link

- Gives a bit more information about signing up

#### Gallery taster

- Gives a taster of the gallery images, appropriate to the page theme 

### Gallery

- Shows a range of photos of interest to users
- Responsive and flexible - so different images can be swapped in and out over time
- Purposefully designed in the style of a noticeboard - not lining images up as they will all be likely different shapes and sizes when users submit and this allows flexibility for that
- Photo description avaialble on hover

### Contact form

- Allows users to sign up for an email list
- Mandatory fields for name and email
- Clear explanation of benefit of signing up

### Signed up

- Confirmation to the user that they have signed up
successfully

### Event sign-up
To be able to sign up for events with a number limit and ability to pay online

### Q&A threads
Consider adding a Q&A style page that users can post in and give answers and get email updates

### Mandatory check box on form
Make at least one checkbox mandatory on the Sign Up form 

### Member login
A member page where you can login and update your mailing preferences and details

### Sign up works!
Mailing form would be connected to an endpoint and a database of details and preferences
