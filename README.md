# SPEEDY FINGERS

Speedy fingers is a fun website that allows a user to practice their typing, encouraging improvement in both accuracy and speed together. Using randomly generated words, with increasing or mixed numbers of letters, the user can compete against themselves to improve the speed and gain both a higher number of accurate words and a faster average speed of word completed.

It's aim is to be simple, but effective - to have a fun response for the user without being overcomplicated or distracting.

### Speedy fingers - the simple but effective way to improve your typing!
As modern life depends more and more on the ability to use a keyboard, in work, at home, in our hobbies and in our general life administration, the ability to type quickly and accurately has become more and more important. A lot of us will spend a large amount of our computing time on mobile phones, which makes typing a lot simpler, but there are still a lot of situations in which we need to use a manual keyboard, and because we don't do that as often, we need some practice!

Using desktop computer applications and websites tend to auto-correct us a lot less, so accuracy is important, as well as speed. When filling in forms it can be essential to get important details correct, otherwise we can cause major delays or miss important information. The key to this is being able to be confident in our ability to type accurately as well as quickly - so that we can get on with the rest of our life, knowing that we have not wasted any unnecessary time.

Speedy fingers is the perfect way to have a bit of fun testing yourself with randomly generated words, starting with shorter words and increasing in length as you progress, with an immediate visual reward to show how well you are doing!

## [Repository - Github](https://github.com/jenniewillson/speedy-fingers)

## Design Choices

The core principles of this website are that it is simple, fun and not distracting. Users should be attracted to using it, encouraged to keep coming back to improve and it should make them smile. It should be immediately obvious how to use it and not require a lot of complicated instructions. The feedback to the user should be obvious and immediately recognisable.

### Colours

The colours are chosen with the design principles in mind of simplicity and fun. I have chosen primary colours, with clear meanings, such as red when something is incorrect and green when it is correct, with yellow (gold) used for the reward!

#### Colour  palette

![Speedy fingers colour palette](https://github.com/jenniewillson/speedy-fingers/assets/127458925/3f833237-454f-4195-9bcc-c79d73e17970)


### Typography

Typography is really important for Speedy fingers, as it is important that it is easy for the user to read what they are typing, without mis-reading words or letters. I initially thought I would be looking for a sans-serif with characters that apppeared as much like the simple writing one is taught as a child. However, having googled to find out more, I discovered from [a Techradar article](https://www.techradar.com/news/google-has-released-a-new-font-it-says-makes-reading-online-easier) that Google's Roboto Serif font had been designed with just this thing in mind, to be the easiest font for reading online. I concluded that Google were the experts on this, rather than me, so have decided to use that font!

I want to ensure the website is as simple as possible, so intend to use the same font for all text, simply adjusting colour, size and format where required.

### Imagery

Images will be fun and relevant, including the use of fun imagery to represent the user's acheivements.

### Animations and Transitions

These will be key to responding to the user's actions and showing their success or failure. As above, recognisable colours will be used to show success or failure in typing the given word and this should be clear and visible to the user, showing for long enough for them to be able to see that they have gone wrong.

## Site Structure

Keeping the principles of the project in mind, the website will be simple and users should be taken immediately to the 'action' without having to navigate through other pages first. Their high score should be clearly visible on the page. There should be a page for feedback, where users can report any concerns or suggestions for improvement and a page to confirm submission - and a custom 404 page too.

Users should not have any difficulty finding everything they need very clearly, allowing them to participate, start a new game and see any relevant information.

## Wireframes

### Mobile Wireframes

This application is not designed for use on mobile devices, so users should be informed of this when they access the page on a smaller screen. It is intended to inprove typing speed on a manual keyboard, not on a text keyboard on a mobile phone. An app designed for mobile users would work differently, need to recognise things like the keyboard taking up a significant amount of the screen but also issues around predictive text use, etc. The need for accuracy and speed is not so great in the same way as on a keyboard. It is a very definite decision that mobiles are not the target for this application and therefore users on smaller screens will received a clear message to this effect, the page will render correctly and they are also able to access links to socials and contact us if they would like.

#### Incorrect spelling
- If a letter is typed incorrectly, that letter will be shown in red so the user is aware it was wrong. At this point the game stops and they will need to start again.
![Incorrect spelling](https://github.com/jenniewillson/speedy-fingers/assets/127458925/6e29e986-977d-47ef-9408-979430d5f807)
